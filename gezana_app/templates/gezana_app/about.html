    <h2>Gezana brings Habesha warmth and flavor to Dublin</h2>
    <p class="lede">
      We serve the dishes we grew up with: feasts built on injera, slow-simmered stews, and coffee poured in three rounds for blessings and conversation.

    <h3>Our Cuisine</h3>
    <p>Soft, tangy injera is the heart of the table, with doro wat, tibs, shiro, and fresh veggie sides served family-style. Berbere and mitmita spices add depth, heat, and warmth to every bite.</p>

    <h3>Coffee Ceremony</h3>
    <p>We hand-roast beans until glossy, grind them fresh, and brew in a clay jebena. The aroma fills the room as we pour three rounds—each shared for friendship and good fortune.</p>
